      <p class="aboutme-p">
        As a born and raised South African, I innately grew a very curious mind for the world and evolved a passion for learning. I had to work several jobs
        during my undergraduate studies and developed a strong sense for hard work and time management, which led to habits of being proactive.
        Educated in Civil Engineering, I pursued project management to further develop my skills for communication, adaptability & problem solving.
        In my spare time, I evidently enjoy learning coding and going for long walks with my partner and dog. I also really enjoy travelling abroad and learning new cultures.
        I always seek a challenge and contstantly strive for success.
